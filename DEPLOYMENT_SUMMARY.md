## 📦 What Happens During Build

```
1. Setup Phase
   └─ Install Node.js 20.x
   └─ Detect pnpm from pnpm-lock.yaml

2. Install Phase
   └─ Run: pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
   └─ Install all dependencies

3. Build Phase
   └─ Run: pnpm run build (Vite build)
   └─ Generate optimized static files in dist/

4. Deploy Phase
   └─ Serve static files from dist/
   └─ Application is live! 🎉
```

## 🔍 Build Output

After successful build, you'll have:

```
dist/
├── index.html           # Main HTML file
├── assets/
│   ├── index-[hash].js  # Bundled JavaScript
│   ├── index-[hash].css # Bundled CSS
│   └── *.png/svg        # Optimized images
└── vite.svg            # Vite logo
```

All files are:
- ✅ Minified
- ✅ Tree-shaken
- ✅ Hash-named for caching
- ✅ Optimized for production

## ⚙️ Environment Variables (Optional)

If you want to make the PocketBase URL configurable:

1. In Coolify, add environment variable:
   ```
   VITE_POCKETBASE_URL=https://api.worldofconnecta.com
   ```

2. Update `src/lib/pocketbase.ts`:
   ```typescript
   const pb = new PocketBase(
     import.meta.env.VITE_POCKETBASE_URL || 
     "https://api.worldofconnecta.com"
   );
   ```

✅ Orb animation works
✅ Form submission succeeds
✅ Success modal with fireworks appears

---

## 📊 Build Performance

- **Install Time**: ~30-60 seconds
- **Build Time**: ~10-30 seconds
- **Total Deployment**: ~1-2 minutes
- **Output Size**: ~500KB-1MB (gzipped)

## 🐛 Common Issues

### Build fails with "command not found: pnpm"
✅ Coolify should auto-detect from `pnpm-lock.yaml`
✅ Check `nixpacks.toml` is present
✅ Verify Node.js version in logs

### Site loads but shows blank page
✅ Check browser console (F12)
✅ Verify `dist` directory is set correctly
✅ Check base path in `vite.config.js`

### API calls fail
✅ Verify PocketBase URL: https://api.worldofconnecta.com
✅ Check CORS settings
✅ Test PocketBase endpoint separately

## 📞 Support

For deployment issues:
1. Check Coolify build logs
2. Review `DEPLOYMENT.md` troubleshooting section
3. Verify all configuration files are committed to Git
4. Ensure PocketBase backend is accessible
