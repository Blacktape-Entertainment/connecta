# Connecta - Deployment Configuration

## For Coolify Deployment

### Simple Configuration (Recommended)

Just set these values in Coolify UI:

**Install Command:**
```
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
```

**Build Command:**
```
pnpm run build
```

**Output Directory:**
```
dist
```

That's it! Coolify will auto-detect Node.js and pnpm from the project files.
